# Machine-Learning
### Task
Create a new repo called "machine-learning" and include a read-me file which will give more information about the repo.
Using the data set provided, carry out an exploratory and explanatory analysis using a jupyter notebook
Push this notebook to the repo ("machine-learning")  and include more information on the read-me of the analysis task to give more context on the dataset and the whole analysis.
The link to the repo should be included in the document that will be provided.


### Introduction
The repository that you have stumbled upon contains a plethora of valuable information that sheds light on the hotel booking demand. The core of this repository is composed of two essential components: the code and the data that was used to perform an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA). The primary objective of this EDA was to thoroughly examine and understand the patterns and trends that emerge from the hotel booking data, and provide insights into the factors that influence booking cancellations.

The data used for this analysis was sourced from the Hotel Booking Demand dataset that is publicly available on Kaggle. This dataset contains a wide range of information on hotel bookings, including data on the number of adults and children, the type of room booked, booking channels, and whether the bookings were canceled or not. With such a rich set of data, this EDA offers the opportunity to glean invaluable insights that could help improve the management of hotel bookings.

The Python programming language was used to perform the EDA and Jupyter Notebooks were used as the platform for this analysis. By utilizing the power of Python, this EDA is capable of accurately identifying and summarizing the most critical trends and patterns within the dataset.

In summary, this repository offers a comprehensive analysis of hotel booking demand, providing detailed insights into the various factors that affect booking cancellations. With the dataset's origins in the Polytechnic Institute of Porto, Portugal, and its availability on Kaggle, this repository is a valuable resource for anyone looking to gain a deeper understanding of hotel booking demand.

### Exploratory Data Analysis for Hotel Booking
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a critical process of examining and analyzing datasets to uncover valuable insights, identify patterns, and understand the underlying relationships among different variables. The purpose of conducting an EDA is to explore the data thoroughly and provide a summary of the key findings that emerge from the analysis.

The EDA process for hotel booking data in this repository involves several key steps that are designed to ensure a comprehensive and insightful analysis. Firstly, the necessary libraries required for visualizing and exploring the dataset are imported. These libraries provide a range of functionalities and tools to help with data cleaning, manipulation, and visualization.

Secondly, the hotel booking dataset is imported or read into the Jupyter Notebook for analysis. Once the data is loaded, it is described to provide an overview of the data's general outlook, including the number of records, columns, and data types. This step helps to identify any initial data quality issues that need to be addressed.

Thirdly, the EDA process involves identifying and fixing any missing or null values that exist within the dataset. This step is essential as it ensures that the analysis is based on accurate and reliable data.

The fourth step of the EDA process involves exploring and visualizing the data. This step involves creating plots and visualizations to help identify patterns and trends within the dataset. These visualizations help to provide a better understanding of the relationships between different variables and can help highlight any correlations or causal relationships that exist.

In summary, the EDA process for hotel booking data in this repository involves importing the necessary libraries, reading or importing the dataset, describing the data, finding and fixing missing values, and exploring and visualizing the data. By following these steps, it is possible to gain valuable insights into hotel booking demand and help identify factors that influence booking cancellations.
